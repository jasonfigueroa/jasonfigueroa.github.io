I created a repo with a bash script and Vagrantfile for quickly spinning up a MySQL database, accessible from the host machine. I will be using this kind of setup for tinkering with Entity Framework Core and MySQL.

The repo and basic instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/jasonfigueroa/vagrant-mysql" target="_blank">here</a>.
